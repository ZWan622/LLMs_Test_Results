Certainly, I'll generate the parsimony phylogenetic tree for these sequences following the Fitch Algorithm steps you've provided. Let's go through this process step-by-step.

Input:
We have four sequences: H, C, G, and O.
Leaf Node Initialization:
H: {T,A,G,C,T,A,C,T}
C: {C,T,A,G,C,T,C,C,C}
G: {C,T,G,G,C,C,A,C,T}
O: {C,T,G,G,A,C,C,C,T}
Bottom-Up Calculation of Internal Nodes:
We need to consider all possible topologies. For four taxa, there are three possible unrooted topologies. Let's examine each:

Topology 1: (H,C),(G,O)
Topology 2: (H,G),(C,O)
Topology 3: (H,O),(C,G)
Let's calculate for each topology:
Topology 1: (H,C),(G,O)
For (H,C):
1: {T,C} (union)
2: {T}
3: {A}
4: {G}
5: {C}
6: {T}
7: {A,C} (union)
8: {C}
9: {T,C} (union)
For (G,O):
1: {C}
2: {T}
3: {G}
4: {G}
5: {A,C} (union)
6: {C}
7: {C}
8: {C}
9: {T}
Root:
1: {C,T} (union)
2: {T}
3: {A,G} (union)
4: {G}
5: {C}
6: {C,T} (union)
7: {C}
8: {C}
9: {T}
Total mutations: 6
Topology 2: (H,G),(C,O)
For (H,G):
1: {T,C} (union)
2: {T}
3: {A,G} (union)
4: {G}
5: {C}
6: {C,A} (union)
7: {C}
8: {C}
9: {T}
For (C,O):
1: {C}
2: {T}
3: {G}
4: {G}
5: {A,C} (union)
6: {C}
7: {C}
8: {C}
9: {C,T} (union)
Root:
1: {C}
2: {T}
3: {G}
4: {G}
5: {C}
6: {C}
7: {C}
8: {C}
9: {T}
Total mutations: 5
Topology 3: (H,O),(C,G)
For (H,O):
1: {T,C} (union)
2: {T}
3: {A,G} (union)
4: {G}
5: {A,C} (union)
6: {A,C} (union)
7: {C}
8: {C}
9: {T}
For (C,G):
1: {C}
2: {T}
3: {A,G} (union)
4: {G}
5: {C}
6: {C}
7: {C,A} (union)
8: {C}
9: {C,T} (union)
Root:
1: {C}
2: {T}
3: {G}
4: {G}
5: {C}
6: {C}
7: {C}
8: {C}
9: {T}
Total mutations: 7

Select the Optimal Tree:
The topology with the minimum number of mutations is Topology 2: (H,G),(C,O) with 5 mutations.
Output in Newick format:
((H,G),(C,O));

This Newick format represents the optimal parsimony phylogenetic tree for the given sequences. The tree groups H with G, and C with O, which corresponds to the topology that required the least number of mutations (5) according to the Fitch Algorithm.
