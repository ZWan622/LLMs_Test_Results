Hamming Distance Matrix:
seq1	seq2	seq3	seq4
seq1	-	12	49	50
seq2	12	-	49	53
seq3	49	49	-	50
seq4	50	53	50	-
Modified Distance Matrix (Q):
seq1	seq2	seq3	seq4
seq1	-	-39	-202	-207
seq2	-39	-	-202	-214
seq3	-202	-202	-	-207
seq4	-207	-214	-207	-
Process Details:
The least distant pair in the Q matrix is identified as seq1 and seq2 with a Q value of -39.
The next step involves creating an internal node that represents the common ancestor of seq1 and seq2.
Following this, the distance matrix should be updated recursively as the algorithm progresses.
