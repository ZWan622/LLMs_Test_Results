Certainly! Let's continue until we build the entire tree.

We have now reached the final step of the algorithm, where we join "node5" and "node6" into a single internal node "node7", which represents the root of the tree. We'll denote this new internal node as "node7".

Now, let's update the distances of "node5" and "node6" to their ancestral node "node7":
Distances:

For "node5":
d(node7, node5) = -93.87109375

For "node6":
d(node7, node6) = -86.6484375

d(node7,node6)=âˆ’86.6484375

With this final step, we have constructed the entire tree, where "node7" serves as the root connecting all sequences.

Here's the final representation of the tree:

    /|-------|
   / |       \------- seq2
/root|-------|
     |       \------- node4
     |               |
     |               \------- seq3
     |       
     \---------------|
                     \------- node6
Each node represents either a sequence or an internal node (common ancestor), and the branches represent the evolutionary distances between them.

We have successfully built the whole tree using the Neighbor-Joining algorithm!
