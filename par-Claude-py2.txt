Fitch Algorithm
Input:
Input the aligned sequences and the given topology.
Leaf Node Initialization:
Represent each leaf node with a single character set. For example, leaf node S1 is represented by the set {A}, leaf node S2 by the set {C}, and so on.


Thank you for providing information about the Fitch algorithm. It seems you've started to describe the initialization step for leaf nodes in the algorithm. Would you like me to explain the next steps of the Fitch algorithm, or do you have any specific questions about this phylogenetic method? I'd be happy to elaborate on how it works for inferring ancestral states or discuss its applications in evolutionary biology.

Bottom-Up Calculation of Internal Nodes:
Start from the leaf nodes and calculate the state of each internal node layer by layer upwards.
For each internal node:
Obtain the character sets of its two child nodes.
Calculate the intersection of the two child nodes' character sets:
If the intersection is not empty, the state of the internal node is the intersection.
If the intersection is empty, the state of the internal node is the union.


Thank you for providing more details about the Fitch algorithm. You've described the bottom-up calculation process for internal nodes, which is a key part of the algorithm. This process allows us to infer the ancestral states at each internal node based on the states of its descendant nodes. Let's break down this step:

Direction of calculation: The algorithm works from the leaf nodes upwards towards the root, which is why it's called a "bottom-up" approach.
For each internal node: a. The algorithm considers the character sets of its two immediate child nodes. b. It then performs set operations on these character sets:
First, it calculates the intersection of the two sets.
The result of this intersection determines the next step:
If the intersection is not empty, it becomes the state of the internal node.
If the intersection is empty, the union of the two sets becomes the state of the internal node.
This process is repeated for all internal nodes, moving up the tree until the root is reached.
This method effectively minimizes the number of evolutionary changes required to explain the observed states at the leaf nodes, following the principle of maximum parsimony.

Would you like me to continue explaining the next steps of the Fitch algorithm, such as the top-down pass for resolving ambiguities, or do you have any questions about this bottom-up calculation process?

Calculate the Mutation Steps:
Initialize the mutation step count to 0.
For each internal node:
If the state of the node is the union of its child nodes' states, increment the mutation step count by 1.
Repeat this step until reaching the root node.


Thank you for providing the next step in the Fitch algorithm. This step is crucial for determining the minimum number of evolutionary changes (mutations) required to explain the observed character states at the leaf nodes. Let's break down this process:

Initialization:
The mutation step count starts at 0.
Counting mutations:
The algorithm examines each internal node, moving from the bottom of the tree towards the root.
For each internal node, it compares its state with the states of its child nodes.
Incrementing the mutation count:
If the state of the internal node is the union of its child nodes' states (rather than the intersection), it indicates that a mutation has occurred.
In this case, the mutation step count is incremented by 1.
Continuation:
This process is repeated for all internal nodes, moving up the tree until the root is reached.
Final count:
After examining all internal nodes, the final mutation step count represents the minimum number of evolutionary changes required to explain the character states observed at the leaf nodes.
This step is important because it quantifies the parsimony of the tree. A lower mutation count indicates a more parsimonious explanation of the observed data, which is generally preferred in phylogenetic analysis.

Would you like me to explain how this mutation count can be used in phylogenetic analysis, or do you have any questions about this step of the algorithm?

This Python script implements the Fitch algorithm to find the most parsimonious phylogenetic tree for the given sequences. Here's a brief explanation of the main components:

The Node class represents nodes in the phylogenetic tree.
fitch_bottom_up performs the bottom-up pass of the Fitch algorithm.
count_mutations counts the number of mutations in the tree.
generate_trees generates all possible tree topologies.
to_newick converts a tree to Newick format.
find_optimal_tree finds the tree with the minimum parsimony score.
calculate_parsimony_score calculates the parsimony score for a given tree.

The script follows your steps:

It considers all possible topologies.
For each topology, it applies the Fitch algorithm to calculate the states of internal nodes.
It counts the total number of mutations (parsimony score) for each topology.
It selects the topology with the minimum parsimony score as the optimal tree.

To run this script, you can simply execute it. It will output the optimal tree in Newick format along with its parsimony score.
Note that this implementation considers all possible tree topologies, which can be computationally expensive for a large number of sequences. For the given 4 sequences, it should run quickly.
Would you like me to explain any part of the code in more detail or help you run it?
