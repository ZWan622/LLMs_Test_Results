Step1：
Write a python program that can calculate the hamming distance of each sequence and then generate a distance matrix

Here’s a Python program to calculate the Hamming distance between all sequences and generate a distance matrix:

Hamming Distance Matrix
This program includes the following:

A function hamming_distance to compute the Hamming distance between two sequences.
A function generate_distance_matrix to calculate a pairwise distance matrix for the sequences.
A function display_distance_matrix to display the matrix in a readable format.
You can run this program with the provided sequences, and it will calculate and display the distance matrix.

Step 2:From the distance matrix, for each tip, compute
$$u_i = \sum_{j\neq i} D(i,j)/(n - 2)$$
An average distance to all other tips, although it is over n-2 instead of n-1. Can you generate a python code for this step?

Step 3:  DIFF(i, j) = D(i, j) - u_i - u_j (Here D(i, j) represents the distance between nodes i and j in the last distance_matrix, for example, DIFF(A,B) = 10 – 16.5 – 15 = -21.5)
Here you should calculate the DIFF between each branch, for example when I have three points A, B and C. I then need to calculate DIFF (A, B), DIFF (B, C), DIFF (A, C)

The code has been updated to include the calculations for:

Step 2: Computing

Step 3: Calculating the DIFF values between each pair of sequences based on the formula

The compute_ui function calculates

Step 4: 
Then select the one with the smallest DIFF(i,j) value and
Connect the tips i and j, forming a new ancestral node with branch lengths to i and j:
$$v_i = (D(i,j) + u_i - u_j)/2$$
$$v_j = (D(i,j) + u_j - u_i)/2$$

Step 5: Update the distance matrix D:
Replace tips i and j by the new node, and regard it as a tip
Distance between the new node and another tip k is:
$$D(\text{{new node}}, k) = (D(i, k) + D(j, k) - D(i,j))/2$$
When performing this step, it is necessary to ensure that in order to prevent errors associated with updating the matrix, nodes other than i and j are placed into the new matrix when updating the matrix, and so on.

The code now includes:

​
Step 5: Updating the distance matrix by merging the selected tips into a new node and recalculating distances to other nodes.
Let me know if you need further steps or adjustments!

Step6:Repeat steps 1-5 until the calculation is down to only two nodes left. 

Step7: And then summarise the previous steps of the calculation and express the result phylogenetic tree  in newick format. [Example, this is a tree in newick format containing five sequences ((seq1:0.1,seq2:0.2):0.3, ((seq3:0.1,seq4:0.2):0.3,seq5:0.4):0.5).]

The code now includes:

Step 6: Repeating steps 1–5 until only two nodes remain, merging nodes step-by-step.
Step 7: Constructing and outputting the resulting phylogenetic tree in Newick format.
The function build_phylogenetic_tree handles the iterative merging of nodes and builds the tree structure, which is output as a Newick string. Let me know if you need further explanations or adjustments!
