It looks like you've provided some nucleotide sequences labeled from seq1 to seq5. How can I assist you with these sequences? Are you looking to analyze or compare them in some way?

To calculate the Hamming distance between each pair of sequences and generate a distance matrix, we'll follow these steps:

Define Hamming Distance: The Hamming distance between two strings of equal length is the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols are different. In this case, we're looking at differences between the nucleotides at each position in your DNA sequences.

Pairwise Comparison: We'll compare each sequence with every other sequence to calculate the Hamming distances.

Construct Distance Matrix: We'll organize these distances into a matrix form, where each cell 
(ùëñ,ùëó)(i,j) represents the distance between sequence i and sequence ùëó.

Here are your sequences for reference:

seq1: CGGTTAGCCTATTCTTTCTCACGGGACTTCCCAAAGGTAAGCTTTTCAGG
seq2: CGGTTAGCGTGTTCTTGCTCACGGGACCTGCGAAAGGTAAGCCTGTCACG
seq3: AACCGTGAAACGACCCCCTCCTCATGCCTAACCAGCGCGAGCGGCCCGCG
seq4: AAACATGCATCGTTCCTCCACTCATGGCCAACCAACCAGGGCGTCCCGGA
seq5: ATGCGTGCCGAGTCCGACTCCGGGTCACCCGTTCACGTTAACGTCTCCGG
Let's go ahead and calculate the Hamming distance between each pair of sequences and construct the distance matrix.

I've calculated the Hamming distance between each pair of your sequences and organized them into a distance matrix as follows:
	seq1	seq2	seq3	seq4	seq5
seq1	0	9	35	36	27
seq2	9	0	34	38	30
seq3	35	34	0	18	28
seq4	36	38	18	0	29
seq5	27	30	28	29	0
Each cell in the matrix represents the Hamming distance between the sequences indicated by the row and column labels. A distance of 0 indicates that the sequences are identical, while larger numbers indicate greater dissimilarity

To compute the value u_i for each sequence i, we will use the formula provided:

u_i = [‚àë_{j ‚â† i} D(i, j)] / (n - 2)

where D(i, j) represents the distance between sequences i and j, and n is the total number of sequences. For your dataset with five sequences, n - 2 will be 3.

Let's calculate u_i for each sequence using the distance matrix we've already constructed.

I've computed the u_i values for each sequence based on the formula provided. Here are the results:

u_seq1 = 35.67
u_seq2 = 37.00
u_seq3 = 38.33
u_seq4 = 40.33
u_seq5 = 38.00

These values represent the average Hamming distance from each sequence to all other sequences, calculated over n - 2 instead of n - 1, where n is the total number of sequences.


To compute the DIFF(i, j) for each pair of sequences i and j, we will use the formula:
DIFF(i, j) = D(i, j) - u_i - u_j
where D(i, j) is the Hamming distance between sequences i and j, and u_i and u_j are the average distances for sequences i and j computed in the previous step.
Let's calculate DIFF(i, j) for each pair of sequences using the values we have from the distance matrix and the u_i values.
I've computed the DIFF(i, j) values for each pair of sequences. Here are the results organized into a matrix:
        seq1      seq2      seq3      seq4      seq5
seq1    -71.33    -63.67    -39.00    -40.00    -46.67
seq2    -63.67    -74.00    -41.33    -39.33    -45.00
seq3    -39.00    -41.33    -76.67    -60.67    -48.33
seq4    -40.00    -39.33    -60.67    -80.67    -49.33
seq5    -46.67    -45.00    -48.33    -49.33    -76.00
Each cell DIFF(i, j) represents the calculated difference between the actual distance D(i, j) and the sum of the average distances u_i and u_j of sequences i and j. Negative values indicate that the actual distance is less than what would be expected based on the average distances to all other sequences.

To proceed with Step 4, we need to:

Identify the smallest DIFF(i, j) value in the matrix to determine which sequences (tips) i and j to connect.

Calculate the branch lengths v_i and v_j for the chosen sequences to their new ancestral node using the given formulas:

v_i = [D(i, j) + u_i - u_j] / 2
v_j = [D(i, j) + u_j - u_i] / 2

Let's first find the pair of sequences with the smallest DIFF(i, j) value and then compute the branch lengths for those sequences.

The pair of sequences with the smallest DIFF(i, j) value is seq1 and seq2. We will connect these two sequences to form a new ancestral node. Here are the computed branch lengths to this new node:

v_seq1 = 3.83
v_seq2 = 5.17

These values represent the branch lengths from seq1 and seq2 to their new ancestral node, calculated based on the differences in their average distances to other sequences and their direct distance from each other.



To update the distance matrix D by replacing the tips i (seq1) and j (seq2) with a new node (let's call it "node12"), we follow this process:

Calculate the distance between the new node "node12" and another tip k using the formula:
D(new_node, k) = [D(i, k) + D(j, k) - D(i, j)] / 2
Construct the new distance matrix by:

Including the distances from the new node to all other existing tips.
Removing the rows and columns corresponding to i and j (seq1 and seq2).
Keeping the remaining nodes intact.
Updated Distance Matrix
The distance matrix has been updated with the new node "node12," which represents the combined node of seq1 and seq2. Here's the revised distance matrix:

Notes:
Rows and columns for seq1 and seq2 have been removed.
A new row and column for "node12" have been added.
The distance between "node12" and other tips (seq3, seq4, seq5) has been calculated using the formula:

Edit
D(new_node, k) = [D(i, k) + D(j, k) - D(i, j)] / 2
This reflects the average distance from seq1 and seq2 to these tips, adjusted by their mutual distance.
This matrix now reflects the new structure with the ancestral node included, and it can be used for further phylogenetic analysis or additional tree-building steps.


To complete the tree construction using the distance matrix method (specifically the Neighbor-Joining algorithm), we must continue repeating the steps from calculating the

  values, selecting pairs with the smallest DIFF value, calculating branch lengths, and updating the distance matrix until only two nodes remain. This iterative process helps in building the phylogenetic tree by continually simplifying the tree until it reaches its basic structure.

Steps:
Calculate

Compute DIFF values for each pair using the new

Select the pair with the smallest DIFF and compute branch lengths.
Update the distance matrix by merging the selected pair into a new node.
Repeat these steps until only two nodes remain.
Issues Encountered and Resolved:
During the iterative process, a KeyError occurred, indicating that the distance values for the newly created node were not correctly updated in the matrix. This was resolved by refining the mechanism for updating the distance matrix, ensuring that all necessary distances for newly created nodes are initialized and accessible.

Final Results:
After resolving the issues, the iterative process successfully reduced the set of nodes to the final two nodes:

Final Nodes:

node(seq3,seq4)
node(seq5,node12)
Distance Between Final Nodes:
The distance between "node(seq3,seq4)" and "node(seq5,node12)" is approximately 8.875.

Branching Information:
node(seq3,seq4) was formed by combining seq3 and seq4 with branch lengths:

8.125 to seq3
9.875 to seq4
node(seq5,node12) was formed by combining seq5 and node12 (which itself was a combination of seq1 and seq2) with branch lengths:

10.625 to seq5
13.375 to node12
Conclusion:
This branching information and the final distance between the two remaining nodes can now be used to construct the final visualization of the phylogenetic tree, illustrating how these sequences are evolutionarily related.
