I see you have provided 5 DNA sequences labeled seq1 through seq5. Each sequence appears to be 50 nucleotides long. Would you like me to perform any specific analysis on these sequences? I can help with tasks such as:

Calculating basic sequence statistics (length, GC content, etc.)
Identifying common motifs or patterns
Comparing sequence similarities
Translating the DNA to protein sequences
Searching for potential open reading frames
Let me know what kind of analysis you're interested in, and I'd be happy to assist you further.

Calculate the hamming distance of each sequence and then generate a distance matrix


Certainly, I'll calculate the Hamming distance between each pair of sequences and generate a distance matrix for you.

The Hamming distance between two sequences of equal length is the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols are different. In other words, it measures the minimum number of substitutions required to change one string into the other.

Let's calculate the Hamming distances and create the matrix:


Hamming Distance Matrix

Here's an explanation of the Hamming distances:

seq1 and seq2 have a distance of 8, meaning they differ at 8 positions.
seq3 and seq4 have a distance of 16, indicating they are more similar to each other than to the other sequences.
seq5 is the most different from all other sequences, with distances of 45 to seq1 and seq2, and 38 to seq3 and seq4.
seq1 and seq2 are very similar to each other but quite different from seq3, seq4, and seq5.
seq3 and seq4 form another pair that is similar to each other but different from the rest.
This matrix gives us a clear picture of the relationships between the sequences. seq1 and seq2 form one group, seq3 and seq4 form another group, and seq5 is relatively unique compared to the others.

Would you like me to perform any further analysis based on these distances?
