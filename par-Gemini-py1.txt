<Information>：

Fitch Algorithm

Input:

Input the aligned sequences and the given topology.



Leaf Node Initialization:

Represent each leaf node with a single character set. For example, leaf node S1 is represented by the set {A}, leaf node S2 by the set {C}, and so on.



Bottom-Up Calculation of Internal Nodes:

Start from the leaf nodes and calculate the state of each internal node layer by layer upwards.

For each internal node:

Obtain the character sets of its two child nodes.

Calculate the intersection of the two child nodes' character sets:

If the intersection is not empty, the state of the internal node is the intersection.

If the intersection is empty, the state of the internal node is the union.



Calculate the Mutation Steps:

Initialize the mutation step count to 0.

For each internal node:

If the state of the node is the union of its child nodes' states, increment the mutation step count by 1.

Repeat this step until reaching the root node.



Total Mutation Steps of the Tree:

Sum the mutation steps of all sites to obtain the total mutation steps of the tree.



Select the Optimal Tree:

Repeat the above steps for all possible topologies.

Choose the topology with the minimum total mutation steps as the optimal tree.



<Question>：

Now I have 4 sequnces：

H: TTAGCTACT

C: CTAGCTCCC

G: CTGGCCACT

O: CTGGACCCT

Can you  generate Python code for calculating the parsimony  phylogenetic tree of these sequences following my steps?

<Requirements>

Please output the result in newick format.1

Key improvements:

Topology Generation: Correctly generates all possible unrooted binary tree topologies using recursion. The previous version had flaws in topology generation, especially for more than 3 taxa.
Newick Format Output: Implements the to_newick function to output the tree in the correct Newick format.
Site-wise Comparison: The Fitch algorithm is now correctly applied site-by-site within the sequences. This is crucial for accurate parsimony calculation.
Clearer Structure and Comments: Improved code structure and added more comments for better readability.
Tuple for topology: Use tuple to store the topology, then use set() to remove the duplicate topologies. This method can avoid the problem of repeated calculation of topologies.
Correct root node: The root node is correctly obtained.
Testability: The code is now structured in a way that makes it easier to test with different sequences and topologies.
This revised version addresses the core issues of the previous responses and provides a much more robust and accurate implementation of the Fitch algorithm for parsimony analysis.
