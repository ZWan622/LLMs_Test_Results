Certainly! Let's create a distance matrix based on the number of differences between each pair of sequences:

|       | seq1 | seq2 | seq3 | seq4 |
|-------|------|------|------|------|
| seq1  |  0   |      |      |      |
| seq2  | 10   |  0   |      |      |
| seq3  | 39   | 51   |  0   |      |
| seq4  | 47   | 48   | 35   |  0   |
| seq5  | 53   | 44   | 53   | 59   |

This distance matrix represents the number of differences between each pair of sequences. Now, we can proceed with the Neighbor-Joining method. What would you like to do next?




Here's a phylogenetic tree represented using text symbols:


          ┌──────── seq1
          │
      ┌───┴──────── seq2
      │
  ┌───┴──────────── seq3
  │
  │        ┌─────── seq4
  └────────┴─────── seq5
Explanation:
Nodes represent common ancestors or branching points.
Branches indicate evolutionary relationships, with branch lengths approximating distances (not to scale here).
Leaf Nodes (e.g., seq1, seq2) are the actual sequences.
