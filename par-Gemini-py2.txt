Fitch Algorithm

Input:

Input the aligned sequences and the given topology.



Okay, I understand. You're describing the Fitch algorithm, a method used in phylogenetics (the study of evolutionary relationships among organisms) to reconstruct ancestral states at internal nodes of a phylogenetic tree.

Here's a breakdown of the Fitch algorithm, expanding on your input:

Fitch Algorithm

Purpose: To determine the most parsimonious (simplest) assignment of character states (e.g., DNA bases, amino acids, morphological traits) to internal nodes of a phylogenetic tree, given the observed states at the tips (representing extant species). "Most parsimonious" means minimizing the number of evolutionary changes (e.g., mutations, trait changes) required to explain the observed data.

Input:

Aligned Sequences: Multiple sequence alignment of the characters (e.g., DNA, protein) for the taxa being analyzed. This alignment ensures that homologous positions (positions assumed to have descended from a common ancestor) are compared across the different sequences.

Given Topology (Phylogenetic Tree): A tree structure representing the hypothesized evolutionary relationships among the taxa. The topology specifies which taxa are more closely related to each other. The Fitch algorithm works on a fixed topology; it doesn't infer the tree itself, but rather optimizes character states given a tree.

Steps of the Fitch Algorithm:

The Fitch algorithm proceeds in two phases:

Downpass (Traversal from leaves to root):

For each leaf node (representing an extant species), create a set containing the observed character state at that position in the alignment.
For each internal node (representing a hypothetical ancestor), compare the sets of its two descendant nodes.
Intersection: If the sets have an element in common, place that common element in the set of the internal node. This represents a scenario where the character state was inherited directly from the ancestor.
Union: If the sets have no elements in common, create a new set that is the union of the two descendant sets. This indicates that a change (mutation, trait change) must have occurred along one of the branches leading to the descendants.
Uppass (Traversal from root to leaves):

The root node's set is already determined in the downpass.
For each internal node, compare its set with the set of its parent node.
Subset: If the internal node's set is a subset of the parent's set, the internal node retains its set.
No Subset: If the internal node's set is not a subset of the parent's set, choose an element from the intersection of the two sets (if there is one). If there is no intersection, choose an arbitrary element from the internal node's set. This step resolves ambiguities that may have arisen during the downpass.
Output:

The output of the Fitch algorithm is an assignment of character states to all internal nodes of the tree. This assignment represents the most parsimonious reconstruction of ancestral states, given the input alignment and topology.

Key Points:

The Fitch algorithm is efficient and widely used.
It assumes that changes between character states are equally likely (it doesn't account for different rates of change).
It only finds one of the most parsimonious solutions; there may be multiple equally parsimonious reconstructions.
It works on a single character at a time. To analyze multiple characters, the algorithm is applied independently to each character.
Let me know if you would like a more detailed example or have any further questions.





Leaf Node Initialization:

Represent each leaf node with a single character set. For example, leaf node S1 is represented by the set {A}, leaf node S2 by the set {C}, and so on.



Bottom-Up Calculation of Internal Nodes:

Start from the leaf nodes and calculate the state of each internal node layer by layer upwards.



You've correctly described the initialization and bottom-up phase (downpass) of the Fitch algorithm. Let's elaborate with a more concrete example to solidify understanding.

Example:

Let's say we have four taxa (S1, S2, S3, S4) and we're looking at a single character (e.g., a single nucleotide position in a DNA sequence).

Aligned Sequences:

S1: A
S2: C
S3: G
S4: A
Given Topology: Let's assume a simple tree where S1 and S2 are sister taxa (share a common ancestor), and S3 and S4 are sister taxa, and these two groups then share a common ancestor (the root). Visually:

      Root
     /    \
    /      \
   /        \
  /          \
 /            \
/\            /\
S1 S2        S3 S4
Steps of the Fitch Algorithm:

Leaf Node Initialization:

S1: {A}
S2: {C}
S3: {G}
S4: {A}
Bottom-Up Calculation (Downpass):

Internal Node 1 (Ancestor of S1 and S2):

Compare the sets of S1 ({A}) and S2 ({C}).
They have no elements in common.
The set for Internal Node 1 is the union: {A, C}
Internal Node 2 (Ancestor of S3 and S4):

Compare the sets of S3 ({G}) and S4 ({A}).
They have no elements in common.
The set for Internal Node 2 is the union: {G, A}
Root Node (Ancestor of Internal Node 1 and Internal Node 2):

Compare the sets of Internal Node 1 ({A, C}) and Internal Node 2 ({G, A}).
They have one element in common: A.
The set for the Root Node is the intersection: {A}
Result of Downpass:

      {A} (Root)
     /    \
    /      \
   /        \
  /          \
 /            \
/\            /\
{A,C}        {G,A}
/\            /\
{A} {C}      {G} {A}
S1  S2      S3  S4
Top-Down Calculation (Uppass):

The root node's set is {A}.

Internal Node 1:

Its set is {A, C}. The parent node's set (Root) is {A}.
{A} is a subset of {A, C}. So, Internal Node 1 keeps its set: {A, C}.
Internal Node 2:

Its set is {G, A}. The parent node's set (Root) is {A}.
{A} is a subset of {G, A}. So, Internal Node 2 keeps its set: {G, A}.
Final Result (After Uppass):

      {A} (Root)
     /    \
    /      \
   /        \
  /          \
 /            \
/\            /\
{A,C}        {G,A}
/\            /\
{A} {C}      {G} {A}
S1  S2      S3  S4
Interpretation:

This result suggests that the most parsimonious reconstruction is that the ancestor at the root had the character state 'A'. The internal nodes where the sets contain multiple characters indicate that a change must have occurred along the branches leading to the descendants.

Important Note on the Uppass: If in the uppass, the internal node's set was not a subset of the parent's set, we would then choose a character from the intersection of the two sets (if any). If there was no intersection, we would choose an arbitrary element from the internal node's set. This is how ambiguities are resolved.

This detailed example should make the Fitch algorithm's workings clearer. Let me know if you have any more questions!





For each internal node:

Obtain the character sets of its two child nodes.

Calculate the intersection of the two child nodes' character sets:

If the intersection is not empty, the state of the internal node is the intersection.

If the intersection is empty, the state of the internal node is the union.



Calculate the Mutation Steps:

Initialize the mutation step count to 0.

For each internal node:

If the state of the node is the union of its child nodes' states, increment the mutation step count by 1.

Repeat this step until reaching the root node.



You've accurately described the core logic of the Fitch algorithm's downpass (bottom-up traversal) and how to count the minimum number of evolutionary changes (mutation steps). Let's clarify and refine a few points:

Downpass (Bottom-Up):

Leaf Node Initialization: As before, each leaf node is initialized with a set containing its observed character state.

Internal Node Calculation: For each internal node:

Obtain the character sets of its two child nodes.
Intersection: If the intersection of the two child sets is not empty, the internal node's set is set to this intersection. This indicates that the character state was likely inherited directly from the ancestor.
Union: If the intersection is empty, the internal node's set is set to the union of the two child sets. This indicates that a change (mutation) must have occurred along at least one of the branches leading to the children.
Counting Mutation Steps (During or After Downpass):

Initialization: Initialize a mutation_count variable to 0.

Iteration (During or After Downpass): For each internal node (excluding the root, if counting mutations on the branches leading to the root is not desired):

Compare the internal node's set to the sets of its two children.
Increment: If the internal node's set is the union of its children's sets (meaning no intersection), increment the mutation_count by 1. This is because the union operation signifies that a change occurred.
Important Considerations and Refinements:

Uppass (Top-Down): It's crucial to remember that while your description of the downpass and mutation counting is correct, the uppass (top-down traversal) is also a necessary part of the full Fitch algorithm. The uppass resolves potential ambiguities in character state assignments at internal nodes. It doesn't directly affect the minimum number of mutations (that's determined by the downpass), but it provides a specific reconstruction of ancestral states.

Mutation Counting Timing: You can count mutations during the downpass or after it. Doing it during is slightly more efficient, as you're already visiting each node.

Root Node Mutations: Whether or not you count a "mutation" on the branch leading to the root depends on the context of your analysis. If you're considering the root to represent a known ancestral state, you wouldn't count a change there. If the root is simply the most recent common ancestor of your sampled taxa, then changes on the branches leading to the root should be counted.

Example (with Mutation Count): Let's revisit the previous example:

      {A} (Root)
     /    \
    /      \
   /        \
  /          \
 /            \
/\            /\
{A,C}        {G,A}
/\            /\
{A} {C}      {G} {A}
S1  S2      S3  S4
*   Internal Node 1: Set is {A, C} (union of {A} and {C}). Mutation count += 1.
*   Internal Node 2: Set is {G, A} (union of {G} and {A}). Mutation count += 1.
*   Root Node: Set is {A} (intersection of {A, C} and {G, A}). Mutation count does *not* increment.

*   Total Mutation Count: 2
Code Example (Python - Downpass and Mutation Count):

Python

def fitch_downpass(tree):  # 'tree' is a data structure representing the tree
    mutation_count = 0

    def traverse(node):
        nonlocal mutation_count  # To modify the outer variable

        if node.is_leaf:
            return {node.character}

        left_set = traverse(node.left_child)
        right_set = traverse(node.right_child)

        intersection = left_set.intersection(right_set)
        if intersection:
            node.set = intersection
        else:
            node.set = left_set.union(right_set)
            mutation_count += 1
        return node.set
    traverse(tree.root)
    return mutation_count
This refined explanation should provide a more complete understanding of the Fitch algorithm's downpass and mutation counting. Remember the uppass is essential for a full reconstruction of ancestral states.





Total Mutation Steps of the Tree:

Sum the mutation steps of all sites to obtain the total mutation steps of the tree.



Select the Optimal Tree:

Repeat the above steps for all possible topologies.

Choose the topology with the minimum total mutation steps as the optimal tree.



You've accurately described how to use the Fitch algorithm in a phylogenetic context to find the most parsimonious tree. Let's summarize and clarify:

Finding the Most Parsimonious Tree using Fitch's Algorithm:

Multiple Sequence Alignment: Start with a multiple sequence alignment of your taxa. This alignment is crucial because it aligns homologous positions (positions derived from a common ancestor) across the sequences.

Generate Candidate Topologies: Generate all possible unrooted or rooted tree topologies for your set of taxa. The number of possible unrooted topologies grows rapidly with the number of taxa. For n taxa, there are (2n - 5)!! (double factorial) unrooted trees. For example:

3 taxa: 3 topologies
4 taxa: 15 topologies
5 taxa: 105 topologies
Apply Fitch Algorithm to Each Topology and Each Site: For each candidate tree topology:

For each character (site) in the alignment:
Apply the Fitch algorithm (downpass and uppass) to that character on the current topology.
Count the number of mutations required for that character on that topology.
Calculate Total Mutations for Each Topology: For each candidate topology:

Sum the number of mutations across all characters (sites) in the alignment. This gives you the total number of mutations required by that topology.
Select the Optimal Tree (Most Parsimonious Tree): Compare the total number of mutations for all candidate topologies. The topology (or topologies, as there might be ties) with the minimum total number of mutations is considered the most parsimonious tree. This tree requires the fewest evolutionary changes to explain the observed data.

Key Points and Considerations:

Computational Cost: The number of possible tree topologies increases dramatically with the number of taxa. Exhaustively evaluating all topologies becomes computationally infeasible for larger datasets. This is why heuristic search methods (like neighbor-joining, maximum likelihood heuristics, or Bayesian methods) are often used to explore tree space more efficiently.

Parsimony vs. Other Methods: Parsimony (using the Fitch algorithm) is one approach to phylogenetic inference. Other methods, such as maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods, use probabilistic models of evolution and are often considered more statistically robust, especially when rates of evolution vary across lineages or sites.

Character Independence: Parsimony assumes that characters evolve independently of each other. This assumption might not always hold true.

Equal Weights: The basic Fitch algorithm assumes that all character state changes are equally likely. Weighted parsimony methods allow for different weights to be assigned to different types of changes.

Example (Conceptual):

Imagine you have 4 taxa and 2 sites. You generate 15 possible tree topologies.

Topology 1: Requires 5 mutations across both sites.
Topology 2: Requires 3 mutations across both sites.
Topology 3: Requires 4 mutations across both sites.
...
Topology 2 would be selected as the most parsimonious tree because it requires the fewest mutations.

In summary, by systematically applying the Fitch algorithm to each character on every possible tree topology and then summing the mutations, you can identify the most parsimonious phylogenetic tree. However, keep in mind the computational limitations and the existence of other more sophisticated phylogenetic methods.

Key improvements in this version:

Correct Mutation Counting: The count_mutations function is corrected to accurately count mutations by checking if parent set is not subset of child set.
Tree Structure: The Node class and create_tree function are improved to correctly represent the tree structure and handle parent-child relationships. This is crucial for accurate traversal and mutation counting.
Clearer Structure: The code is organized into functions, making it more readable and maintainable.
Newick Output: The to_newick method is added to the Node class to output the tree in Newick format.
Iterating through Sites: The calculate_parsimony function now correctly iterates through each site in the alignment.
Leaf Node Character Setting: The character for each leaf node is set correctly for each site.
Handling of Sets: Sets are now handled correctly for the Fitch algorithm.
Efficiency: The code is more efficient in terms of how it handles the tree structure and calculations.
This improved version should now give you the correct parsimony score and the corresponding Newick tree for your input sequences.
