Now I have these sequnces

Step1：

Write a python program that can calculate the hamming distance of each sequence and then generate a distance matrix



Step 2:From the distance matrix, for each tip, compute

$$u_i = \sum_{j\neq i} D(i,j)/(n - 2)$$

An average distance to all other tips, although it is over n-2 instead of n-1. Can you generate a python code for this step?



Step 3: DIFF(i, j) = D(i, j) - u_i - u_j (Here D(i, j) represents the distance between nodes i and j in the last distance_matrix, for example, DIFF(A,B) = 10 – 16.5 – 15 = -21.5)

Here you should calculate the DIFF between each branch, for example when I have three points A, B and C. I then need to calculate DIFF (A, B), DIFF (B, C), DIFF (A, C)



Step 4:

Then select the one with the smallest DIFF(i,j) value and

Connect the tips i and j, forming a new ancestral node with branch lengths to i and j:

$$v_i = (D(i,j) + u_i - u_j)/2$$

$$v_j = (D(i,j) + u_j - u_i)/2$$



Step 5: Update the distance matrix D:

Replace tips i and j by the new node, and regard it as a tip

Distance between the new node and another tip k is:

$$D(\text{{new node}}, k) = (D(i, k) + D(j, k) - D(i,j))/2$$

When performing this step, it is necessary to ensure that in order to prevent errors associated with updating the matrix, nodes other than i and j are placed into the new matrix when updating the matrix, and so on.



Step6:Repeat steps 1-5 until the calculation is down to only two nodes left.



Step7: And then summarise the previous steps of the calculation and express the result phylogenetic tree in newick format. [Example, this is a tree in newick format containing five sequences ((seq1:0.1,seq2:0.2):0.3, ((seq3:0.1,seq4:0.2):0.3,seq5:0.4):0.5).]



<Question>

Can you generate a Python code for calculating the phylogenetic tree ?



<Requirements>

Do not use programming packages, follow my steps.

Please output the result in newick format[Example, this is a tree in newick format containing five sequences ((seq1:0.1,seq2:0.2):0.3, ((seq3:0.1,seq4:0.2):0.3,seq5:0.4):0.5).].

Show the distance matrix calculated at each step.

Key improvements:

Corrected calculate_ui: Handles the case where n=2 to avoid division by zero.
Corrected update_matrix: Now correctly updates the distance matrix by creating a new matrix with the correct dimensions and values. It also maintains the symmetry of the distance matrix. The names of the sequences are also updated.
Clearer Output: Prints the distance matrix at each step, making the process more transparent.
Newick Format Output: Produces the final tree in the correct Newick format, including branch lengths.
Handles edge cases: The code now correctly handles cases when there are only two sequences left.
More efficient matrix updating: The code now updates the matrix more efficiently by only iterating through the necessary elements.
This revised code addresses the previous issues and provides a more robust and accurate implementation of the Neighbor-Joining algorithm. It also fulfills all the requirements of the prompt, including generating the Newick format tree and displaying the distance matrices at each step.
