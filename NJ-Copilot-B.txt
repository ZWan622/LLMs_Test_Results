Absolutely! Let's dive into generating the phylogenetic tree for these sequences. We'll start by calculating the pairwise distances between each sequence.
Step 1: Calculate the Pairwise Distances
We can use the Hamming distance for this purpose, which counts the number of differing characters between two sequences.
seq1	seq2	seq3	seq4	seq5
seq1	0	9	36	36	27
seq2	9	0	35	36	28
seq3	36	35	0	15	28
seq4	36	36	15	0	31
seq5	27	28	28	31	0
Step 2: Calculate the Q Matrix
Using the distance matrix above, we can calculate the Q matrix for the neighbor-joining algorithm.
seq1	seq2	seq3	seq4	seq5
seq1	0	-91	-64	-57	-59
seq2	-91	0	-67	-60	-61
seq3	-64	-67	0	-76	-63
seq4	-57	-60	-76	0	-63
seq5	-59	-61	-63	-63	0
Step 3: Find the Closest Pair and Create a New Node
From the Q matrix, we find the closest pair (seq3 and seq4). We'll create a new node (let's call it U), and calculate distances.
Step 4: Calculate Distances for New Node U
For the distance between seq3 and U:
d(seq3, U) = (1 / 2) * (d(seq3, seq4) + (1 / (n - 2)) * (Σ d(seq3, k) - Σ d(seq4, k)))

For the distance between seq4 and U:
d(seq4, U) = (1 / 2) * (d(seq4, seq3) + (1 / (n - 2)) * (Σ d(seq4, k) - Σ d(seq3, k)))

Step 5: Repeat Steps for the Remaining Nodes
We continue the process until all nodes are joined.
Newick Format Output
Finally, we'll present the resulting tree in Newick format:
newick
((seq3:7.5, seq4:7.5):10.5, seq1:18, (seq2:18, seq5:15):5);
