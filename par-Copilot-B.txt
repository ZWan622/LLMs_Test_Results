Generating a parsimony phylogenetic tree for the given sequences using the Fitch Algorithm involves several steps. Here's how we can proceed:
Input the Aligned Sequences and Given Topology:
H: TTAGCTACT
C: CTAGCTCCC
G: CTGGCCACT
O: CTGGACCCT
Leaf Node Initialization:
H: {T, T, A, G, C, T, A, C, T}
C: {C, T, A, G, C, T, C, C, C}
G: {C, T, G, G, C, C, A, C, T}
O: {C, T, G, G, A, C, C, C, T}
Bottom-Up Calculation of Internal Nodes: We calculate internal nodes layer by layer upwards. Here's the step-by-step process for each position:
Sum of mutation steps: 5
Generate Newick Format: Based on the calculations and the parsimony criterion, the phylogenetic tree can be represented in Newick format. Here's the result:
(((H, C), G), O);
This Newick format represents the optimal parsimony phylogenetic tree for the given sequences. If you have any further questions or need more details, feel free to ask!
