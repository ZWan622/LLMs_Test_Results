Step1Ôºö
Write a python program that can calculate the hamming distance of each sequence and then generate a distance matrix

Step 2:From the distance matrix, for each tip, compute
$$u_i = \sum_{j\neq i} D(i,j)/(n - 2)$$
An average distance to all other tips, although it is over n-2 instead of n-1. Can you generate a python code for this step?

Certainly! First, I'll write a Python script for Step 1 that computes the Hamming distance between each pair of sequences and creates a distance matrix. The Hamming distance between two DNA sequences is the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols are different.

Step 1: Create the Hamming Distance Matrix
python
Copy
def hamming_distance(seq1, seq2):
    """Calculate the Hamming distance between two sequences"""
    if len(seq1) != len(seq2):
        raise ValueError("Sequences must be of equal length")
    return sum(ch1 != ch2 for ch1, ch2 in zip(seq1, seq2))

sequences = {
    "seq1": "CGGTTAGCCTATTCTTTCTCACGGGACTTCCCAAAGGTAAGCTTTTCAGG",
    "seq2": "CGGTTAGCGTGTTCTTGCTCACGGGACCTGCGAAAGGTAAGCCTGTCACG",
    "seq3": "AACCGTGAAACGACCCCCTCCTCATGCCTAACCAGCGCGAGCGGCCCGCG",
    "seq4": "AAACATGCATCGTTCCTCCACTCATGGCCAACCAACCAGGGCGTCCCGGA",
    "seq5": "ATGCGTGCCGAGTCCGACTCCGGGTCACCCGTTCACGTTAACGTCTCCGG"
}

# Create a matrix of Hamming distances
keys = sorted(sequences.keys())
distance_matrix = []
for key1 in keys:
    row = []
    for key2 in keys:
        if key1 == key2:
            row.append(0)
        else:
            distance = hamming_distance(sequences[key1], sequences[key2])
            row.append(distance)
    distance_matrix.append(row)

# Print the distance matrix
for line in distance_matrix:
    print(line)
Step 2: Compute

        sum_distances = sum(distance_matrix[i])  # Sum of all distances for sequence i
        ui.append(sum_distances / (n - 2))  # Compute average over n-2
    return ui

# Compute u_i for each sequence
ui_values = compute_ui(distance_matrix)

# Print the u_i values

    print(f"{key}: {ui}")
This code will produce a list of average distances

Step 3:  DIFF(i, j) = D(i, j) - u_i - u_j (Here D(i, j) represents the distance between nodes i and j in the last distance_matrix, for example, DIFF(A,B) = 10 ‚Äì 16.5 ‚Äì 15 = -21.5)
Here you should calculate the DIFF between each branch, for example when I have three points A, B and C. I then need to calculate DIFF (A, B), DIFF (B, C), DIFF (A, C)

Step 4: 
Then select the one with the smallest DIFF(i,j) value and
Connect the tips i and j, forming a new ancestral node with branch lengths to i and j:
$$v_i = (D(i,j) + u_i - u_j)/2$$
$$v_j = (D(i,j) + u_j - u_i)/2$$

Step 5: Update the distance matrix D:
Replace tips i and j by the new node, and regard it as a tip
Distance between the new node and another tip k is:
$$D(\text{{new node}}, k) = (D(i, k) + D(j, k) - D(i,j))/2$$
When performing this step, it is necessary to ensure that in order to prevent errors associated with updating the matrix, nodes other than i and j are placed into the new matrix when updating the matrix, and so on.

For steps 3, 4, and 5 of the process, which involve calculating differences, forming a new ancestral node, and updating the distance matrix, I'll provide a Python script that iteratively carries out these tasks. This approach reflects a part of the Neighbor-Joining method used in phylogenetics to construct trees based on distance data.

Python Script for Steps 3, 4, and 5

import numpy as np

# Given data from previous steps
sequences = ["seq1", "seq2", "seq3", "seq4", "seq5"]
distance_matrix = np.array([

def calculate_diff(distance_matrix, ui):

    diff_matrix = np.zeros_like(distance_matrix, dtype=float)

        for j in range(n):
            if i != j:
                diff_matrix[i, j] = distance_matrix[i, j] - ui[i] - ui[j]
    return diff_matrix

# Calculate DIFF
diff_matrix = calculate_diff(distance_matrix, ui)

# Step 4: Find the minimum DIFF and form a new node
min_value = np.inf
min_index = (-1, -1)
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(i + 1, n):
        if diff_matrix[i, j] < min_value:
            min_value = diff_matrix[i, j]
            min_index = (i, j)

i, j = min_index
vi = (distance_matrix[i, j] + ui[i] - ui[j]) / 2
vj = (distance_matrix[i, j] + ui[j] - ui[i]) / 2

# Step 5: Update the distance matrix
new_distance_matrix = []
new_sequences = []
for k in range(n):
    if k != i and k != j:
        new_sequences.append(sequences[k])
        new_row = [(distance_matrix[i, k] + distance_matrix[j, k] - distance_matrix[i, j]) / 2 for l in range(n) if l != i and l != j]
        new_distance_matrix.append(new_row)

new_sequences.append(f"({sequences[i]},{sequences[j]})")
new_row = []
for k in range(len(new_distance_matrix)):
    new_row.append((distance_matrix[i, k] + distance_matrix[j, k] - distance_matrix[i, j]) / 2)
new_row.append(0)  # distance to itself
new_distance_matrix.append(new_row)

# Convert to numpy array for easier manipulation in future steps
new_distance_matrix = np.array(new_distance_matrix)

# Display the new distance matrix and new sequences
print("New Sequences:", new_sequences)
print("New Distance Matrix:")
print(new_distance_matrix)
This script:

Calculates the DIFF matrix.
Identifies the pair of sequences with the smallest DIFF value.
Forms a new node by connecting these sequences and calculating their distances to the new node.
Updates the distance matrix by replacing the two old nodes with the new node and recalculating distances accordingly.
This process would need to be repeated until all sequences are joined into a single phylogenetic tree. Each iteration effectively reduces the number of sequences by one, gradually building a complete tree structure.

Step7: And then summarise the previous steps of the calculation and express the result phylogenetic tree  in newick format. [Example, this is a tree in newick format containing five sequences ((seq1:0.1,seq2:0.2):0.3, ((seq3:0.1,seq4:0.2):0.3,seq5:0.4):0.5).]

Certainly! Below is a Python script that implements the Neighbor-Joining algorithm to generate a phylogenetic tree in Newick format, following the steps you outlined. The script iteratively calculates DIFF values, forms new nodes, updates the distance matrix, and reduces the set of nodes until only two remain. It then expresses the resulting phylogenetic relationships in Newick format.

The final Newick format output provides the phylogenetic relationships with branch lengths specified, which can be visualized using any tree-drawing software that supports Newick format.

It seems there was an error during the update of the distance matrix, likely caused by inconsistencies in array sizes while attempting to build the new matrix rows. Let's correct the script to ensure that the distance matrix is updated correctly in each iteration.

I'll adjust the code to handle the new node distances more carefully and ensure consistent matrix dimensions. Let's fix and rerun it.
