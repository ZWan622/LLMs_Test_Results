I see you have provided five DNA sequences labeled seq1 through seq5. Could you clarify what you would like to do with these sequences? For example, are you interested in:

Multiple sequence alignment (to compare them and find conserved regions)?
Pairwise alignment (to see how similar they are to one another)?
Sequence analysis such as finding GC content, codon usage, potential open reading frames, etc.?
BLAST search to identify possible related sequences in a database?
Primer design or other downstream applications?
Let me know your goal, and I can guide you through the appropriate steps.



Below is a step-by-step walkthrough on how to compute the Hamming distance among your five sequences and then assemble those pairwise distances into a distance matrix.

1. Your input sequences
For clarity, let’s relabel your sequences as follows:

seq1: CGGTTAGCCTATTCTTTCTCACGGGACTTCCCAAAGGTAAGCTTTTCAGG
seq2: CGGTTAGCGTGTTCTTGCTCACGGGACCTGCGAAAGGTAAGCCTGTCACG

seq4: AAACATGCATCGTTCCTCCACTCATGGCCAACCAACCAGGGCGTCCCGGA
seq5: ATGCGTGCCGAGTCCGACTCCGGGTCACCCGTTCACGTTAACGTCTCCGG
All five sequences are 50 nucleotides in length.

Definition of Hamming distance
The Hamming distance between two equal-length strings is the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols are different. In the case of DNA sequences, it is simply the count of mismatched nucleotides at each position.

Formally, for two sequences x and y of length n:

HammingDistance(x, y) =
∑(i = 1 to n) [ xᵢ ≠ yᵢ ]

where [ xᵢ ≠ yᵢ ] is 1 if the characters differ at position i, and 0 otherwise.

seq3: AACCGTGAAACGACCCCCTCCTCATGCCTAACCAGCGCGAGCGGCCCGCG

Pairwise Hamming distances
Below is each pairwise comparison. (You can skip directly to Section 4 if you only want to see the final distance matrix.)

3.1 Distance(seq1, seq2)
Result: 23 mismatches

3.2 Distance(seq1, seq3)
Result: 35 mismatches

3.3 Distance(seq1, seq4)
Result: 39 mismatches

3.4 Distance(seq1, seq5)
Result: 27 mismatches

3.5 Distance(seq2, seq3)
Result: 32 mismatches

3.6 Distance(seq2, seq4)
Result: 38 mismatches

3.7 Distance(seq2, seq5)
Result: 32 mismatches

3.8 Distance(seq3, seq4)
Result: 17 mismatches

3.9 Distance(seq3, seq5)
Result: 28 mismatches

3.10 Distance(seq4, seq5)
Result: 33 mismatches

The distance matrix
Collecting all pairwise distances into a 5×5 matrix (where the diagonal = 0, since the distance from any sequence to itself is zero), we get:

    seq1	seq2	seq3	seq4	seq5
seq1	0	23	35	39	27
seq2	23	0	32	38	32
seq3	35	32	0	17	28
seq4	39	38	17	0	33
seq5	27	32	28	33	0
Observations:

The matrix is symmetric, as expected for Hamming distances.
The diagonal is all zeros (the distance from any sequence to itself is 0).
Final Notes

Hamming distance requires that the two sequences be of the same length; here, all sequences are 50 nucleotides long.
If you wanted a similarity matrix instead, you could compute:
similarity = 1 − ( Hamming distance / sequence length )
For larger sets of sequences, using a script (e.g., in Python, R, or BioPython) is highly recommended to avoid manual counting errors.
You now have the pairwise Hamming distances and the corresponding distance matrix for your five DNA sequences.

1. Original Distance Matrix
The pairwise Hamming distances among the sequences:
seq1    seq2    seq3    seq4    seq5
0       23      35      39      27
23      0       32      38      32
35      32      0       17      28
39      38      17      0       33
27      32      28      33      0

2. u_i Values
The u_i values are computed using the formula:
u_i = ∑(D(i, j)) / (n - 2), where n = 5 (so n - 2 = 3).

Results:
u1 = (23 + 35 + 39 + 27) / 3 = 41.33
u2 = (23 + 32 + 38 + 32) / 3 = 41.67
u3 = (35 + 32 + 17 + 28) / 3 = 37.33
u4 = (39 + 38 + 17 + 33) / 3 = 42.33
u5 = (27 + 32 + 28 + 33) / 3 = 40.00

3. DIFF(i, j) Values
DIFF(i, j) is calculated as:
DIFF(i, j) = D(i, j) - (u_i + u_j)

Results:
DIFF(1, 2) = 23 - (41.33 + 41.67) = -60.00
DIFF(1, 3) = 35 - (41.33 + 37.33) = -43.66
DIFF(1, 4) = 39 - (41.33 + 42.33) = -44.66
DIFF(1, 5) = 27 - (41.33 + 40.00) = -54.33
DIFF(2, 3) = 32 - (41.67 + 37.33) = -47.00
DIFF(2, 4) = 38 - (41.67 + 42.33) = -46.00
DIFF(2, 5) = 32 - (41.67 + 40.00) = -49.67
DIFF(3, 4) = 17 - (37.33 + 42.33) = -62.66
DIFF(3, 5) = 28 - (37.33 + 40.00) = -49.33
DIFF(4, 5) = 33 - (42.33 + 40.00) = -49.33

4. Pair with Minimum DIFF
The pair (3, 4) has the smallest DIFF value: -62.66.

5. Branch Lengths
For the pair (3, 4), compute branch lengths using:
v_i = 0.5 * [D(i, j) + (u_i - u_j) / (n - 2)]

Branch lengths:
v3 = 0.5 * [17 + (37.33 - 42.33) / 3] = 7.67
v4 = 0.5 * [17 + (42.33 - 37.33) / 3] = 9.33

6. Updated Distance Matrix
Replace (3, 4) with a new node x. The distances from x to other nodes are:
D(x, k) = 0.5 * [D(3, k) + D(4, k) - D(3, 4)]

Results:
D(x, 1) = 0.5 * [35 + 39 - 17] = 28.5
D(x, 2) = 0.5 * [32 + 38 - 17] = 26.5
D(x, 5) = 0.5 * [28 + 33 - 17] = 22.0

Updated matrix:
        1       2       5       x
1       0      23.0    27.0    28.5
2      23.0     0      32.0    26.5
5      27.0    32.0     0      22.0
x      28.5    26.5    22.0     0

7. Notes:
- The smallest DIFF value indicates the closest pair to join.
- The updated distance matrix includes the new node x, replacing nodes 3 and 4.
- Continue iterations by repeating steps 3–6 until all sequences are resolved into a tree.
