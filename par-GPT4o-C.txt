ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To generate a parsimony-based phylogenetic tree from the provided sequences, we will follow these steps:

Define the sequences and identify differences:

Align the sequences: H, C, G, and O.
Identify and count the sites where sequences differ, as these are potential points of parsimony (minimum changes).
Determine the topology:

Use the given topology or create possible topologies.
Assess each topology for its parsimony score by counting the minimum number of changes required for the sequences to fit that tree.
Calculate parsimony score:

Evaluate all internal nodes (ancestral sequences) and compute the parsimony score for each topology.
Select the most parsimonious tree:

The tree with the least total changes is the best parsimony tree.

Step 3: Calculate Parsimony
For each internal node, infer the ancestral state based on the sequences and minimize changes. Then sum up the total number of changes for this topology.

We will calculate the parsimony for each variable position. Let's infer ancestral states based on majority and possible states.

Would you like me to compute these changes step by step or present the resulting parsimony tree directly?

To represent each leaf node with a single character set, we assign the characters in the sequences to sets. Each leaf node corresponds to a sequence, and the positions in the sequence are treated as elements of that node's set. Here's the initialization for your sequences:

Leaf Node C:

Leaf Node G:

Character Set Representation at Each Leaf Node:

S3 (G): {C, T, G, G, C, C, A, C, T}
S4 (O): {C, T, G, G, A, C, C, C, T}
Each sequence is now represented as a set of characters at their respective leaf nodes.

Let‚Äôs proceed with the bottom-up calculation of internal nodes by applying the rules you‚Äôve outlined.

Tree Topology:
Assume the following topology for clarity:

lua
Copy
Edit
     +---- H (S1)
     |
  +--|      +---- C (S2)
  |  |
  |  +----------- G (S3)
  |
  +--------------- O (S4)
Leaf Node States:
S1 (H): {T, T, A, G, C, T, A, C, T}
S2 (C): {C, T, A, G, C, T, C, C, C}
S3 (G): {C, T, G, G, C, C, A, C, T}
S4 (O): {C, T, G, G, A, C, C, C, T}
We now calculate the states of the internal nodes layer by layer.

Step 1: Calculate Node X (Parent of S1 and S2)
Child nodes: S1 = {T, T, A, G, C, T, A, C, T} and S2 = {C, T, A, G, C, T, C, C, C}
Intersection:
{T, T, A, G, C, T, A, C, T} ‚à© {C, T, A, G, C, T, C, C, C} = {T, A, G, C}
State of Node X: {T, A, G, C}
Step 2: Calculate Node Y (Parent of S3 and S4)
Child nodes: S3 = {C, T, G, G, C, C, A, C, T} and S4 = {C, T, G, G, A, C, C, C, T}
Intersection:
{C, T, G, G, C, C, A, C, T} ‚à© {C, T, G, G, A, C, C, C, T} = {C, T, G, A}
State of Node Y: {C, T, G, A}
Step 3: Calculate Node Z (Root Node, Parent of X and Y)
Child nodes: X = {T, A, G, C} and Y = {C, T, G, A}
Intersection:
{T, A, G, C} ‚à© {C, T, G, A} = {T, A, G, C} (The sets are identical in this case)
State of Node Z: {T, A, G, C}
Results:
Internal Node X (Parent of H and C): {T, A, G, C}
Internal Node Y (Parent of G and O): {C, T, G, A}
Root Node Z (Parent of X and Y): {T, A, G, C}
This concludes the bottom-up calculation for internal nodes. Would you like to visualize this tree or proceed with further analysis?

Mutation Step Calculation
We will calculate the mutation steps as described, starting with an initial step count of 0 and working our way up through the internal nodes.

Internal Nodes and Their States:
Leaf Nodes:

S1 (H): {T, T, A, G, C, T, A, C, T}
S2 (C): {C, T, A, G, C, T, C, C, C}
S3 (G): {C, T, G, G, C, C, A, C, T}
S4 (O): {C, T, G, G, A, C, C, C, T}
Internal Nodes:

Node X (Parent of H and C): {T, A, G, C}
Node Y (Parent of G and O): {C, T, G, A}
Root Node Z (Parent of X and Y): {T, A, G, C}
Mutation Step Count Process:
Step 1: Node X (Parent of H and C)
Child nodes:
S1 = {T, T, A, G, C, T, A, C, T}
S2 = {C, T, A, G, C, T, C, C, C}
Intersection: {T, A, G, C}
Union: {T, A, G, C, T, C}
State of Node X: {T, A, G, C} (Equal to the intersection, no mutation)
Step 2: Node Y (Parent of G and O)
Child nodes:
S3 = {C, T, G, G, C, C, A, C, T}
S4 = {C, T, G, G, A, C, C, C, T}
Intersection: {C, T, G, A}
Union: {C, T, G, A, C}
State of Node Y: {C, T, G, A} (Equal to the intersection, no mutation)
Step 3: Root Node Z (Parent of X and Y)
Child nodes:
Node X = {T, A, G, C}
Node Y = {C, T, G, A}
Intersection: {T, A, G, C}
Union: {T, A, G, C}
State of Root Node Z: {T, A, G, C} (Equal to the intersection, no mutation)
Total Mutation Steps:
No node required the union of child states to determine its state.
Total mutation steps = 0.
This indicates that the tree is completely parsimonious, with no additional mutation events required. Would you like further details or a visualization of this tree and process?

Prompt 5: Total Mutation Steps of the Tree
To calculate the total mutation steps for the entire tree:

Mutation Steps for Each Site: Each site in the sequences contributes to the total mutation steps based on whether the states of internal nodes and their children require union or intersection.

Calculate mutation steps for each site independently by applying the same rules of union and intersection at each internal node.

Steps for Each Site:
Position 1: {T}, {C}, {C}, {C}
Root state {C} requires 1 mutation (union needed at Node X).
Position 2: {T, T, T, T}
All identical: no mutation required.
Position 3: {A}, {A}, {G}, {G}
Root state {A, G} requires 1 mutation (union needed at Node Z).
Position 4: {G}, {G}, {G}, {G}
All identical: no mutation required.
Position 5: {C}, {C}, {C}, {A}
Root state {C, A} requires 1 mutation.
Position 6: {T}, {T}, {C}, {C}
Root state {T, C} requires 1 mutation.
Position 7: {A}, {C}, {A}, {C}
Root state {A, C} requires 1 mutation.
Position 8: {C}, {C}, {C}, {C}
