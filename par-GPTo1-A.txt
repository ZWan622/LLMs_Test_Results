To generate the phylogenetic tree using the Fitch parsimony algorithm for your four sequences:

H: TTAGCTACT
C: CTAGCTCCC
G: CTGGCCACT
O: CTGGACCCT
Step 1: List the sequences by position

First, align the sequences and list the nucleotides at each position:

Position	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9
H	T	T	A	G	C	T	A	C	T
C	C	T	A	G	C	T	C	C	C
G	C	T	G	G	C	C	A	C	T
O	C	T	G	G	A	C	C	C	T
Step 2: Consider all possible unrooted tree topologies

For four taxa, there are three possible unrooted tree topologies:

Tree 1: ((H, C), (G, O))
Tree 2: ((H, G), (C, O))
Tree 3: ((H, O), (C, G))
Step 3: Apply the Fitch parsimony algorithm

For each tree, calculate the minimum number of character state changes required at each position.

Tree 1: ((H, C), (G, O))

Total Parsimony Score: 7
Position	Changes
1	1
2	0
3	1
4	0
5	1
6	1
7	2
8	0
9	1
Tree 2: ((H, G), (C, O))

Total Parsimony Score: 8
Tree 3: ((H, O), (C, G))

Total Parsimony Score: 9
Step 4: Choose the tree with the lowest parsimony score

Tree 1 has the lowest parsimony score of 7, making it the most parsimonious tree.

Phylogenetic Tree:

      /-- H
   ---|
      \-- C
----|
      /-- G
      |
      \-- O
Interpretation:

H and C are sister taxa, indicating they are more closely related to each other.
G and O form another clade, suggesting a closer relationship between them.
This tree requires the least number of evolutionary changes to explain the observed sequences.
Conclusion:

Using the Fitch parsimony algorithm, the most parsimonious phylogenetic tree for your sequences is Tree 1: ((H, C), (G, O)).
