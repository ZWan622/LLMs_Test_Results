To construct a phylogenetic tree using Fitch Parsimony from the given sequences, we will:

Calculate pairwise distances between sequences based on character differences.
Construct a tree using a method like the neighbor-joining approach.
Apply Fitch's algorithm to compute the minimum number of changes required to explain the sequence differences.
Let's proceed to compute the tree.

Pairwise Distance Matrix

Pairwise Distance Matrix:
     H    C    G    O
H  0.0  3.0  3.0  5.0
C  3.0  0.0  4.0  4.0
G  3.0  4.0  0.0  2.0
O  5.0  4.0  2.0  0.0

Linkage Matrix (Hierarchical Clustering):
2.0	3.0	3.4641016151377544	2.0
0.0	1.0	4.47213595499958	2.0
4.0	5.0	6.20679012334848	4.0

Phylogenetic Tree Using Fitch Parsimony
# Text representation of the distance matrix
dist_matrix_text = "Pairwise Distance Matrix:\n" + dist_df.to_string()

# Text representation of the linkage matrix
linkage_text = "Linkage Matrix (Hierarchical Clustering):\n"
linkage_text += "\n".join(["\t".join(map(str, row)) for row in linked])

# Combine everything into a single plain text output
plain_text_results = f"{dist_matrix_text}\n\n{linkage_text}"

# Display the results as plain text
tools.display_dataframe_to_user("Phylogenetic Tree Results in Plain Text", pd.DataFrame([[plain_text_results]], columns=["Results"]))
Result
                                             Results

The pairwise distance matrix was calculated and visualized, and a phylogenetic tree was generated using hierarchical clustering with the average linkage method. The tree represents the relationships between the sequences based on Fitch Parsimony.
