Sure! Here’s an R program that calculates the Hamming distance between each pair of sequences and generates a distance matrix:
R
# Define the sequences
seq1 <- "CGGTTAGCCTATTCTTTCTCACGGGACTTCCCAAAGGTAAGCTTTTCAGG"
seq2 <- "CGGTTAGCGTGTTCTTGCTCACGGGACCTGCGAAAGGTAAGCCTGTCACG"
seq3 <- "AACCGTGAAACGACCCCCTCCTCATGCCTAACCAGCGCGAGCGGCCCGCG"
seq4 <- "AAACATGCATCGTTCCTCCACTCATGGCCAACCAACCAGGGCGTCCCGGA"
seq5 <- "ATGCGTGCCGAGTCCGACTCCGGGTCACCCGTTCACGTTAACGTCTCCGG"

# Store the sequences in a list
sequences <- list(seq1, seq2, seq3, seq4, seq5)

# Function to calculate Hamming distance
hamming_distance <- function(seq1, seq2) {
  sum(seq1 != seq2)
}

# Initialize distance matrix
distance_matrix <- matrix(0, nrow = length(sequences), ncol = length(sequences))

# Calculate Hamming distances
for (i in 1:length(sequences)) {
  for (j in 1:length(sequences)) {
    if (i != j) {
      distance_matrix[i, j] <- hamming_distance(unlist(strsplit(sequences[[i]], "")),
                                                unlist(strsplit(sequences[[j]], "")))
    }
  }
}

# Print the distance matrix
print(distance_matrix)
In this program:
We define the sequences and store them in a list.
We implement a function to calculate the Hamming distance between two sequences.
We initialize a distance matrix to store the Hamming distances.
We loop through each pair of sequences, calculate the Hamming distance, and store it in the distance matrix.
Finally, we print the distance matrix.
You can run this program in your R environment to calculate the Hamming distances and generate the distance matrix! If you need any additional help or modifications, just let me know.
Step 2:From the distance matrix, for each tip, compute $$u_i = \sum_{j\neq i} D(i,j)/(n - 2)$$ An average distance to all other tips, although it is over n-2 instead of n-1. Can you generate a R code for this step? Step 3: DIFF(i, j) = D(i, j) - u_i - u_j (Here D(i, j) represents the distance between nodes i and j in the last distance_matrix, for example, DIFF(A,B) = 10 – 16.5 – 15 = -21.5) Here you should calculate the DIFF between each branch, for example when I have three points A, B and C. I then need to calculate DIFF (A, B), DIFF (B, C), DIFF (A, C)
Absolutely! Here's an R code snippet that continues from the previous step to compute 
u
i
 and the DIFF values:
Step 2: Compute 
u
i
R
# Number of sequences
n <- length(sequences)

# Calculate u_i for each sequence
u <- numeric(n)
for (i in 1:n) {
  u[i] <- sum(distance_matrix[i, -i]) / (n - 2)
}

# Print the u_i values
print(u)
Step 3: Compute DIFF(i, j)
R
# Initialize DIFF matrix
DIFF_matrix <- matrix(0, nrow = n, ncol = n)

# Calculate DIFF values
for (i in 1:n) {
  for (j in 1:n) {
    if (i != j) {
      DIFF_matrix[i, j] <- distance_matrix[i, j] - u[i] - u[j]
    }
  }
}

# Print the DIFF matrix
print(DIFF_matrix)
This code:
Compute ui for each sequence:
For each sequence i, compute ui by summing the distances to all other sequences and dividing by (n - 2): ui = Σ(j ≠ i) D(i, j) / (n - 2).

Initialize and compute the DIFF matrix:

Initialize a DIFF matrix of the same size as the distance matrix.
Calculate the DIFF values using the formula:
DIFF(i, j) = D(i, j) - ui - uj.
You can run these code snippets sequentially after the first program to compute the required values. If you need further assistance, feel free to ask!
Step 4: Then select the one with the smallest DIFF(i,j) value and Connect the tips i and j, forming a new ancestral node with branch lengths to i and j: $$v_i = (D(i,j) + u_i - u_j)/2$$ $$v_j = (D(i,j) + u_j - u_i)/2$$ Step 5: Update the distance matrix D: Replace tips i and j by the new node, and regard it as a tip Distance between the new node and another tip k is: $$D(\text{{new node}}, k) = (D(i, k) + D(j, k) - D(i,j))/2$$ When performing this step, it is necessary to ensure that in order to prevent errors associated with updating the matrix, nodes other than i and j are placed into the new matrix when updating the matrix, and so on.
Alright! Let's tackle these steps one by one.
Step 4: Selecting the Pair with the Smallest DIFF(i, j) and Forming a New Ancestral Node
Here's how you can do that in R:
R
# Find the indices of the pair with the smallest DIFF value
min_DIFF_index <- which(DIFF_matrix == min(DIFF_matrix[DIFF_matrix != 0]), arr.ind = TRUE)
i <- min_DIFF_index[1]
j <- min_DIFF_index[2]

# Calculate branch lengths v_i and v_j
v_i <- (distance_matrix[i, j] + u[i] - u[j]) / 2
v_j <- (distance_matrix[i, j] + u[j] - u[i]) / 2

# Print the new branch lengths
cat("Branch length to tip", i, ":", v_i, "\n")
cat("Branch length to tip", j, ":", v_j, "\n")
Step 5: Updating the Distance Matrix
Replace tips 
i
 and 
j
 by the new node and update the distances.
R
# Initialize new distance matrix
new_distance_matrix <- matrix(0, nrow = n - 1, ncol = n - 1)

# Fill the new distance matrix with updated distances
new_node_index <- 1
for (k in 1:n) {
  if (k != i && k != j) {
    new_distance_matrix[new_node_index, new_node_index] <- 0
    new_distance_matrix[n, new_node_index] <- (distance_matrix[i, k] + distance_matrix[j, k] - distance_matrix[i, j]) / 2
    new_distance_matrix[new_node_index, n] <- new_distance_matrix[n, new_node_index]
    new_node_index <- new_node_index + 1
  }
}

# Add the new node to the sequences list (optional for keeping track)
sequences[[length(sequences) + 1]] <- paste("New node (from tips", i, "and", j, ")")

# Print the updated distance matrix
print(new_distance_matrix)
This code:
Finds the pair of sequences with the smallest DIFF value.
Calculates the branch lengths 
v
i
 and 
v
j
 for the new ancestral node.
Creates a new distance matrix by updating the distances between the new node and the other tips, while excluding the original tips 
i
 and 
j
.
Run these snippets sequentially after the previous steps to proceed with your analysis. If you encounter any issues or need further guidance, feel free to ask!
