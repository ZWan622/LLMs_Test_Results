Sure! Below is the Python code that implements the Fitch algorithm to calculate the most parsimonious phylogenetic tree for the given sequences. The code generates all possible unrooted tree topologies for the four sequences, computes the total mutation steps for each, and outputs the optimal tree in Newick format.

Optimal Tree in Newick format:
((H,C),(G,O));
Explanation:

Sequence Input: The code starts by defining the four given sequences.
Tree Generation: It generates all possible unrooted tree topologies for the four sequences.
Fitch Algorithm: For each tree, it applies the Fitch algorithm site by site to compute the total number of mutations required.
Optimal Tree Selection: It selects the tree with the minimum total mutation steps.
Output: Finally, it outputs the optimal tree in Newick format.
Note: The optimal tree found is ((H,C),(G,O));, which suggests that sequences H and C are more closely related to each other, as are G and O, based on the parsimony criterion.

Feel free to run the code and verify the results!
