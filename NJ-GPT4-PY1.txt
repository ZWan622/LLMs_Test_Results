Creating a Python code to compute a phylogenetic tree using the steps you provided is a detailed and somewhat complex task, especially without the use of specialized libraries. Below is a simplified implementation that adheres to your steps. Note that the code will provide verbose outputs to help you track the progress through each step.

Here's the implementation:

python

    """Calculate the Hamming distance between two sequences"""
    return sum(c1 != c2 for c1, c2 in zip(seq1, seq2))

    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            distance = hamming_distance(sequences[i], sequences[j])
            distance_matrix[i][j] = distance_matrix[j][i] = distance
    return distance_matrix

def calculate_ui(distance_matrix):
    """Calculate average distance ui for each sequence"""
    n = len(distance_matrix)
    ui = [sum(row) / (n - 2) for row in distance_matrix]

    """Calculate DIFF values for each pair of nodes"""
    n = len(distance_matrix)
    diff_matrix = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            diff = distance_matrix[i][j] - ui[i] - ui[j]
            diff_matrix[i][j] = diff_matrix[j][i] = diff

                min_pair = (i, j)

            new_matrix.append([new_row[m] for m in range(len(new_row) if m != k - (k > j) - (k > i)] + [distance_matrix[k][m] for m in range(n) if m != i and m != j])
    return new_matrix

def construct_newick(pair, vi, vj, remaining_labels):
    """Construct Newick format string from the remaining nodes and merged pair"""
    i, j = pair

    remaining_labels = [x for x in remaining_labels if x != label_i and x != label_j]
    return remaining_labels[0] if len(remaining_labels) == 1 else remaining_labels

# Example sequences (as you provided)

# Initialize labels and run the algorithm
labels = [f"seq{i+1}" for i in range(len(sequences))]
while len(sequences) > 1:

This code will execute the steps described by you, iterating through the sequence data until it reduces down to a single Newick-formatted string representing the phylogenetic tree. You might need to adjust or debug parts of it depending on specific data or results.
