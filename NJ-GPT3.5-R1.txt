Key Steps Explained:
Installing and Loading the ape Package:

The script checks if the ape package is installed. If not, it installs it and loads it using library(ape).
Defining the Distance Matrix:

A symmetric distance matrix is created with the sequences labeled "A", "B", "C", and "D".
Constructing the Phylogenetic Tree:

The nj() function from the ape package is used to generate the Neighbor Joining tree.
Plotting the Tree:

The plot() function visualizes the tree.
