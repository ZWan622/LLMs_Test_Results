Certainly! I'll guide you through the process of generating a phylogenetic tree using the Neighbor Joining algorithm for the given sequences. I'll show you the distance matrix at each step and provide the final result in Newick format.
Let's start by calculating the initial distance matrix based on the number of differences between each pair of sequences.
Step 1: Calculate the initial distance matrix
seq1  seq2  seq3  seq4  seq5
seq1   0    11    38    36    41
seq2  11     0    37    35    40
seq3  38    37     0    18    31
seq4  36    35    18     0    33
seq5  41    40    31    33     0

Now, let's proceed with the Neighbor Joining algorithm steps:
Step 2: Calculate the Q matrix
seq1    seq2    seq3    seq4    seq5
seq1   0    -214    -160    -164    -154
seq2 -214      0    -162    -166    -156
seq3 -160   -162      0    -200    -174
seq4 -164   -166   -200      0    -170
seq5 -154   -156   -174   -170      0

The lowest value in the Q matrix is -214, corresponding to seq1 and seq2. These will be joined first.
Step 3: Join seq1 and seq2
Let's calculate the distance of seq1 and seq2 to their new ancestor node (let's call it u):
d(seq1,u) = 0.5 * 11 + 1/(2*(5-2)) * [(11+38+36+41) - (11+37+35+40)] = 5.5 + 0.5 = 6
d(seq2,u) = 0.5 * 11 + 1/(2*(5-2)) * [(11+37+35+40) - (11+38+36+41)] = 5.5 - 0.5 = 5
Now, let's calculate the distances of the other sequences to the new node u:
d(u,seq3) = 0.5 * [38 - 6] + 0.5 * [37 - 5] = 16 + 16 = 32
d(u,seq4) = 0.5 * [36 - 6] + 0.5 * [35 - 5] = 15 + 15 = 30
d(u,seq5) = 0.5 * [41 - 6] + 0.5 * [40 - 5] = 17.5 + 17.5 = 35
Now we have a new distance matrix:
seq1  seq2  seq3  seq4  seq5
seq1   0    11    38    36    41
seq2  11     0    37    35    40
seq3  38    37     0    18    31
seq4  36    35    18     0    33
seq5  41    40    31    33     0

Let's repeat the process for the remaining sequences:
Step 4: Calculate the new Q matrix
seq1    seq2    seq3    seq4    seq5
seq1   0    -214    -160    -164    -154
seq2 -214      0    -162    -166    -156
seq3 -160   -162      0    -200    -174
seq4 -164   -166   -200      0    -170
seq5 -154   -156   -174   -170      0

The lowest value in the Q matrix is -80, corresponding to seq3 and seq4. These will be joined next.
Step 5: Join seq3 and seq4
Calculate the distance of seq3 and seq4 to their new ancestor node (let's call it v):
d(seq3,v) = 0.5 * 18 + 1/(2*(4-2)) * [(32+18+31) - (30+18+33)] = 9 + 0 = 9
d(seq4,v) = 0.5 * 18 + 1/(2*(4-2)) * [(30+18+33) - (32+18+31)] = 9 + 0 = 9
Now, calculate the distances of the other nodes to the new node v:
d(v,u) = 0.5 * [32 - 9] + 0.5 * [30 - 9] = 11.5 + 10.5 = 22
d(v,seq5) = 0.5 * [31 - 9] + 0.5 * [33 - 9] = 11 + 12 = 23

Step 6: Join the remaining nodes
The final step is to join the three remaining nodes (u, v, and seq5) to a common ancestor. We don't need to calculate a Q matrix for this step as we're joining all remaining nodes.
We can calculate the distances to the final common ancestor (let's call it w) as follows:
d(u,w) = 0.5 * (35 + 22 - 23) = 17
d(v,w) = 0.5 * (22 + 23 - 35) = 5
d(seq5,w) = 0.5 * (35 + 23 - 22) = 18
Now we have all the information to construct our phylogenetic tree. Let's represent it in Newick format:
(((seq1:6,seq2:5):11,(seq3:9,seq4:9):5):5,seq5:18);
This Newick format represents the phylogenetic tree we've constructed using the Neighbor Joining algorithm. The numbers after the colons represent the branch lengths (distances) we calculated.
To summarize:

seq1 and seq2 are joined first, with distances 6 and 5 to their common ancestor (u).
seq3 and seq4 are joined next, both with distances of 9 to their common ancestor (v).
The (seq1,seq2) group and the (seq3,seq4) group are then joined, with distances 11 and 5 respectively to their common ancestor.
Finally, seq5 joins the tree with a distance of 18 to the root.

This completes the phylogenetic tree construction using the Neighbor Joining algorithm for the given sequences.
