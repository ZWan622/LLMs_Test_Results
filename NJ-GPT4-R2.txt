Certainly! Let's tackle this task step by step.

Step 1: Calculate the Hamming Distance Matrix
The Hamming distance between two DNA sequences is the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols are different. We'll write a function in R to calculate this distance between each pair of sequences and generate a distance matrix.

r
Copy
# Define sequences as a list
sequences <- list(
  seq1 = "CGGTTAGCCTATTCTTTCTCACGGGACTTCCCAAAGGTAAGCTTTTCAGG",
  seq2 = "CGGTTAGCGTGTTCTTGCTCACGGGACCTGCGAAAGGTAAGCCTGTCACG",
  seq3 = "AACCGTGAAACGACCCCCTCCTCATGCCTAACCAGCGCGAGCGGCCCGCG",
  seq4 = "AAACATGCATCGTTCCTCCACTCATGGCCAACCAACCAGGGCGTCCCGGA",
  seq5 = "ATGCGTGCCGAGTCCGACTCCGGGTCACCCGTTCACGTTAACGTCTCCGG"
)

# Function to calculate Hamming Distance
hamming_distance <- function(seq1, seq2) {
  sum(unlist(strsplit(seq1, "")) != unlist(strsplit(seq2, "")))
}

# Create a matrix to hold the distances
n <- length(sequences)
distance_matrix <- matrix(nrow=n, ncol=n)

# Fill the matrix with hamming distances
for (i in 1:n) {
  for (j in 1:n) {
    if (i == j) {
      distance_matrix[i, j] <- 0
    } else {
      distance_matrix[i, j] <- hamming_distance(sequences[[i]], sequences[[j]])
    }
  }
}

# Print the distance matrix
print(distance_matrix)
Step 2: Compute 
𝑢
𝑖
u

Given the distance matrix, you want to compute 
𝑢

  for each sequence, which is the average distance to all other sequences, adjusted by dividing by 
𝑛
−

n−2 instead of 
𝑛

n−1.

r
Copy
# Function to calculate u_i for each sequence
u_i <- function(distance_matrix) {
  n <- nrow(distance_matrix)
  ui <- numeric(n)
  
  for (i in 1:n) {
    ui[i] <- sum(distance_matrix[i, -i]) / (n - 2)
  }
  return(ui)
}

# Calculate u_i using the distance matrix
ui_values <- u_i(distance_matrix)
names(ui_values) <- names(sequences)

# Print the u_i values
print(ui_values)
Running the R Scripts
The provided R code can be run in any R environment. It will output the Hamming distance matrix for the sequences first and then the 
𝑢
𝑖
u 
i
​
  values for each sequence. Make sure to have your sequences correctly inputted, and check if your environment supports these functions as written.

Step 3:  DIFF(i, j) = D(i, j) - u_i - u_j (Here D(i, j) represents the distance between nodes i and j in the last distance_matrix, for example, DIFF(A,B) = 10 – 16.5 – 15 = -21.5)
Here you should calculate the DIFF between each branch, for example when I have three points A, B and C. I then need to calculate DIFF (A, B), DIFF (B, C), DIFF (A, C)

Step 4: 
Then select the one with the smallest DIFF(i,j) value and
Connect the tips i and j, forming a new ancestral node with branch lengths to i and j:
$$v_i = (D(i,j) + u_i - u_j)/2$$
$$v_j = (D(i,j) + u_j - u_i)/2$$

For steps 3 and 4, we will extend the previous R code to calculate the DIFF(i, j) matrix and then find the pair (i, j) with the smallest DIFF(i, j). After identifying the smallest value, we calculate the branch lengths v_i and v_j for the tips i and j.

Here's how you can implement these steps in R:

Step 3: Calculate DIFF(i, j)
r
Copy
# Function to calculate DIFF matrix
calculate_diff <- function(distance_matrix, ui) {
  n <- nrow(distance_matrix)
  diff_matrix <- matrix(0, nrow=n, ncol=n)
  
  for (i in 1:n) {
    for (j in 1:n) {
      if (i != j) {
        diff_matrix[i, j] <- distance_matrix[i, j] - ui[i] - ui[j]
      }
    }
  }
  return(diff_matrix)
}

# Calculate the DIFF matrix
diff_matrix <- calculate_diff(distance_matrix, ui_values)
print(diff_matrix)
Step 4: Select the Minimum DIFF(i, j) and Calculate Branch Lengths
r
Copy
# Function to find the minimum DIFF(i, j) and calculate v_i and v_j
find_and_connect <- function(diff_matrix, distance_matrix, ui) {
  n <- nrow(diff_matrix)
  
  # Find the minimum value in the DIFF matrix and its indices
  min_diff <- min(diff_matrix[diff_matrix != 0])  # Exclude diagonal
  min_indices <- which(diff_matrix == min_diff, arr.ind = TRUE)
  
  # Assuming the first pair is the one we need (in case of ties)
  i <- min_indices[1, 1]
  j <- min_indices[1, 2]
  
  # Calculate v_i and v_j
  d_ij <- distance_matrix[i, j]
  v_i <- (d_ij + ui[i] - ui[j]) / 2
  v_j <- (d_ij + ui[j] - ui[i]) / 2
  
  return(list(pair = c(i, j), v_i = v_i, v_j = v_j, min_diff = min_diff))
}

# Connect the nodes with the smallest DIFF
connection <- find_and_connect(diff_matrix, distance_matrix, ui_values)
print(connection)
Explanation of the R Code
Calculate DIFF: We first compute the DIFF matrix, which considers the differences between each pair's actual distance and their respective average distances to other nodes.
Select Minimum DIFF and Calculate Branch Lengths: After computing the DIFF matrix, the code identifies the pair of sequences with the smallest DIFF value, suggesting they are the closest genetically. It then calculates the branch lengths v_i and v_j to connect these sequences with their new ancestral node.
This stepwise R code will give you a systematic approach to build a phylogenetic tree based on the given sequences, focusing on their evolutionary relationships.

Step 5: Update the distance matrix D:
Replace tips i and j by the new node, and regard it as a tip
Distance between the new node and another tip k is:
$$D(\text{{new node}}, k) = (D(i, k) + D(j, k) - D(i,j))/2$$
When performing this step, it is necessary to ensure that in order to prevent errors associated with updating the matrix, nodes other than i and j are placed into the new matrix when updating the matrix, and so on.

In Step 5, we update the distance matrix by replacing the tips 
𝑖
i and 
𝑗
j with a new node after they've been connected as described in previous steps. The new node represents the ancestor of these tips, and the distances from this new node to all other tips are recalculated. Below is the R code to perform this matrix update and integrate the new node into the analysis.

Step 5: Update the Distance Matrix

r
Copy
# Function to update the distance matrix with the new node
update_distance_matrix <- function(distance_matrix, i, j) {
  n <- nrow(distance_matrix)
  new_n <- n - 1  # new matrix will have one less row/column
  
  # New distance matrix initialization
  new_distance_matrix <- matrix(0, nrow=new_n, ncol=new_n)
  
  # Labels for the new and old matrices
  old_labels <- colnames(distance_matrix)
  new_labels <- old_labels[-c(i, j)]
  new_labels <- c(new_labels, "new_node")
  
  # Fill the new distance matrix

    for (l in (k+1):new_n) {
      if (new_labels[k] != "new_node" && new_labels[l] != "new_node") {
        # Copy old distances for unaffected nodes
        old_k <- match(new_labels[k], old_labels)
        old_l <- match(new_labels[l], old_labels)
        new_distance_matrix[k, l] <- distance_matrix[old_k, old_l]
        new_distance_matrix[l, k] <- distance_matrix[old_l, old_k]
      } else {
        # Calculate distances involving the new node
        other_tip <- ifelse(new_labels[k] == "new_node", new_labels[l], new_labels[k])
        other_tip_index <- match(other_tip, old_labels)
        new_distance_matrix[k, l] <- (distance_matrix[i, other_tip_index] + distance_matrix[j, other_tip_index] - distance_matrix[i, j]) / 2
        new_distance_matrix[l, k] <- new_distance_matrix[k, l]
      }
    }
  }
  
  # Update row and column names
  colnames(new_distance_matrix) <- new_labels
  rownames(new_distance_matrix) <- new_labels
  
  return(new_distance_matrix)
}

# Apply the update function using the connection indices from the previous step
new_distance_matrix <- update_distance_matrix(distance_matrix, connection$pair[1], connection$pair[2])
print(new_distance_matrix)
Explanation and Further Steps
Initialization: The new distance matrix has dimensions reduced by one to account for the merging of two tips into a new node.
Matrix Filling: Distances not involving the new node are directly copied from the old matrix. Distances involving the new node are calculated using the formula given.
Labels Update: The matrix is updated with labels to reflect the new node replacing the two tips.
After updating the distance matrix, you can iterate through these steps (Steps 3 to 5) until all nodes have been processed and the phylogenetic tree is fully constructed. This iterative process gradually reduces the matrix size by incorporating pairs of sequences into new nodes and recalculating distances until a complete hierarchical tree structure is formed.

To create a phylogenetic tree based on the steps you outlined, without using any specialized R packages, we need to implement a series of functions that will iteratively compute and update the distance matrix, form new nodes, and keep track of the tree structure. This structure will finally be expressed in the Newick format.

Let's break down the required R code into the functions and main computation loop:

Define Functions
We'll reuse the hamming_distance, calculate_diff, find_and_connect, and update_distance_matrix functions as previously defined.

Main Loop
In the main loop, we'll iteratively combine sequences until only two nodes remain, then format the result in the Newick format.

r
Copy
# Main function to compute the phylogenetic tree
compute_phylogenetic_tree <- function(sequences) {
  # Initialize
  labels <- names(sequences)
  n <- length(sequences)
  tree_nodes <- labels
  
  # Step 1: Calculate initial distance matrix
  distance_matrix <- sapply(labels, function(x) sapply(labels, function(y) hamming_distance(sequences[[x]], sequences[[y]])))
  colnames(distance_matrix) <- labels
  rownames(distance_matrix) <- labels
  
  # Store initial distance matrix
  print("Initial Distance Matrix:")
  print(distance_matrix)
  
  # Main loop: iterate until we have two nodes left
  while (length(tree_nodes) > 2) {
    # Step 2: Calculate u_i values
    ui_values <- sapply(1:nrow(distance_matrix), function(i) sum(distance_matrix[i, -i]) / (length(tree_nodes) - 2))
    
    # Step 3: Calculate DIFF matrix
    diff_matrix <- calculate_diff(distance_matrix, ui_values)
    
    # Step 4: Find the minimum DIFF and calculate v_i and v_j
    connection <- find_and_connect(diff_matrix, distance_matrix, ui_values)
    i <- connection$pair[1]
    j <- connection$pair[2]
    
    # Step 5: Update the distance matrix
    distance_matrix <- update_distance_matrix(distance_matrix, i, j)
    new_node <- paste0("(", tree_nodes[i], ":", connection$v_i, ",", tree_nodes[j], ":", connection$v_j, ")")
    tree_nodes <- tree_nodes[-c(i, j)]
    tree_nodes <- c(tree_nodes, new_node)
    
    # Update labels for next iteration
    print(paste("Updated Distance Matrix with", length(tree_nodes), "nodes:"))
    print(distance_matrix)
  }
  
  # Final two nodes
  final_i <- 1
  final_j <- 2
  final_dist <- distance_matrix[final_i, final_j]
  final_tree <- paste0("(", tree_nodes[final_i], ":", final_dist / 2, ",", tree_nodes[final_j], ":", final_dist / 2, ");")
  
  return(final_tree)
}

  seq5 = "ATGCGTGCCGAGTCCGACTCCGGGTCACCCGTTCACGTTAACGTCTCCGG"
)

newick_tree <- compute_phylogenetic_tree(sequences)
cat("Final Phylogenetic Tree in Newick Format:\n", newick_tree)
Key Points
The provided code iterates through all sequences, combining the two closest at each step based on the DIFF matrix.
After each combination, it recalculates distances for the newly formed node.
The final output is in Newick format, representing the phylogenetic relationships and branch lengths.
This R script can be run in any standard R environment, and will produce a Newick format tree reflecting the evolutionary relationships among the input sequences.
